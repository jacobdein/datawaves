Web application for managing soundscape recordings

Datawaves is a [Django](https://github.com/django/django)-powered web application for managing recordings of the natural acoustic environment (soundscapes). Datawaves builds upon [pumilio](https://github.com/ljvillanueva/pumilio) and leverages the Django framework to better organize the code and to make it easier for researchers to customize and improve.

## status

Datawaves is being developed as a tool to support the [alpine-soundscapes](https://github.com/jacobdein/alpine-soundscapes) project. Currently, the application contains features that are specific to that project; however, these features will be gradually improved for general use.
